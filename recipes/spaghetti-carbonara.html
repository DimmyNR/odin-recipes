        </p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>100g pancetta</li>
            <li>50g pecorino cheese</li>
            <li>50g parmesan</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>350g spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole</li>
            <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil</li>
            <li>
                Chop up the 100g of pancetta, after removing the rind. 
                Finely grate 50g of pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat 3 large eggs in a medium bown and season it with some freshly grated
                black pepper. Set everything aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 1 teaspoon of salt to the boiling water, add 350g of spaghetti and when 
                the water comes to a boil, cook at a constant simmer for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the side of a knife.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta and garlic. Drop 50g 
                of unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and tip the pancetta/garlic 
                after the butter has melted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes while stirring, until the 
                pancetta becomes gold and crisp. The garlic should have diffused its flavour
                by now, so remove it with a spoon and discard.
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep the heat low for the pancetta. Once the pasta is ready, lift from the 
                water and put into the frying pan with the pancetta (Don't chuck out the pasta 
                water yet).
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix most of the cheese with the eggs (while keeping a little bit for later).
            </li>
            <li>
                Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Then, pour in the eggs and
                cheese. Using tongs, lift the spaghetti so it mixes with the egg cheese mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a few tablespoons of the pasta cooking water in order to keep it saucy
                until it is moist but not wet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve onto a plate or bowl and sprinkle the remaining cheese and some black pepper.
            </li>
