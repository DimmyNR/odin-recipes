        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
           This is one of my favourite dishes overall. A creamy, smooth and somewhat viscous 
           texture combined with the taste and aroma of pumpkins will be sure to make 
           most people start salivating.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>4 cups pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 and a half teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
            <li>5 whole black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Put the chicken stock, pumpkin, garlic, salt, thyme, and peppercorns
                in a large pot and bring it to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered
                for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer soup to a blender or food processor in batches; blend until it gains
                a smooth consistency. Then, return the soup to the pan and bring it to a boil again.
                Reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add heavy cream and stir.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve soup into bowls and sprinkle fresh parsley.
