        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>As the name would suggest, it's just a pizza with a flattened dough base.
           However, it is a very simple and easy to make dish that only requires common
           household ingredients and around 15 minutes of your time to make.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup lukewarm water</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water (44 degrees C) in a bowl.
                Let it sit until the yeast softens and starts to form a foam like substance
                (around 5-8 minutes).
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine 1 and 3/4 cups of flour and salt in a large bowl. Pour in the 
                yeast mixture and mix it well until the dough forms into one substance.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lay the dough onto a foured surface and knead it until it is smooth.
                Then, add the remaining 1/4 cup of flour if the dough is too sticky.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll the dough into a 12-inch circle before putting it on a greased pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top the crust with any toppings you desire and bake at 260 degrees C until
                it turns to a gold colour (around 8-10 minutes).
            </li>
        </ol>
